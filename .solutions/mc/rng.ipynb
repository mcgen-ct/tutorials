If the cycle is long enough, much longer than any sequence of RNs we ever use in practice, then there is hope that this sequence will have the desired properties of random numbers.

One infamous such routine, `RANDU`, with a = 65539 and m = $2^{31}$, was widespread on IBM mainframe computers for many years, and widely copied onto other systems. One of us recalls as a graduate student producing a \"random\" plot with only 11 planes and being told by his computer center's programming consultant that he had misused the random number generator: \"We guarantee that each number is random individually, but we don't guarantee that more than one of them is random.\" That set back our graduate education by at least a year!"

Its properties are understood by studying the multiplication of 3 special kinds of 32- or 64-dimensional binary matrices, but it can be programmed easily using bit shift and XOR operations.

This is because a bit shift can be represented on an n-bit vector by a matrix with only ones on a sub-diagonal. Thus, to right-shift a bit sequence $\\beta = (b_1,b_2,\\cdots,b_n) \\to \\beta^{'} = (0,b_1,b_2,\\cdots,b_{n-1})$, you would right multiply by an $n\\times n$ matrix with only $1$s above the diagonal:",
