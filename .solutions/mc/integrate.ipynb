    "Typical events produced within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from colliding protons have $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ or more particles produced. When calculating a cross-section for a two-to-two process we typically only need to integrate over two variables, $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. A two-to-$n$ process requires integrating over $3n -4$ variables, so a typical LHC event would require integrating over $\\mathcal{O}(300)$ variables. This is numerically challenging, at best, and with current technology is just simply not possible. To calcululate LHC events, we can instead factorise the problem into more manageable parts using probabilistic methods. Even still, calculating a perturbative cross-section for a $4$-body final state requires integrating over $8$ variables which is a challenging numerical integration. The bottom line is that performing high dimension integrals quickly and efficiently is a core problem in particle physic, and is very numerically challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we tackle integration with MC, we need to first discuss how we can efficiently sample distributions. In the [`rng.ipynb`](mc/rng.ipynb) notebook, we have hard to make a good generator for uniformly-distributed random variates. In practice, however, the probability distributions of interest are not uniform. Fortunately, uniform random variates can either be transformed into a different distribution or used as part of an accept/reject algorithm that converges to the desired probability distribution. Random variates -- uniform or not -- are also a primary part of the Monte Carlo integration method, so it is worthwhile to know how to transform uniform into complicated.\n",
