In the previous example, because there are no previous feature dimensions as the problem was 1D, $g_{1}$ was simply $g_{1}=[\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1}]$.\n",

In this case, masking allows for the conditioner to be a single set of Neural Networks, one for each parameter of $f$, each of them a function $\\mathbb{R}^{K}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is evaluated for $x_{i,1:k-1}$ simply by masking or setting to zero the $k:K$ remaining entries.\n",

Coupling flows are equally fast in the forward and backward directions, so there is no difference between density estimation and sampling.
