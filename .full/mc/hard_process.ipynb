In Pythia, the event generation roughly proceeds through the following steps.\n",

With quantum mechanics we can calculate the probability of transitioning from state $A$ at time $-\\infty$ to state $B$ at time $+\\infty$.

Fermions are spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ and can take on two helicity eigenvalues, either $+1$ or $-1$.
