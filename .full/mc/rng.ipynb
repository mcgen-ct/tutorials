    "This has implications for RNGs. Any algorithm that is deterministic and shuffles through the numbers is bound to repeat itself. Further, if our algorithm uses one number as the seed for the next, this repetition will mean that the sequence of pRNs repeats itself. This hardly looks random. Much of the art in developing good RNGs is knowing how to characterize or calculate the length of these cycles. If the cycle is long enough, much longer than any sequence of RNs we ever use in practice, then there is hope that this sequence will have the desired properties of random numbers. Identifying an algorithm with a long cycle is a priority, and possibly led to the focus on modular arithmetic, to be discussed shortly."

Thus, to right-shift a bit sequence $\\beta = (b_1,b_2,\\cdots,b_n) \\to \\beta^{'} = (0,b_1,b_2,\\cdots,b_{n-1})$, you would right multiply by an $n\\times n$ matrix with only $1$s above the diagonal:\n",
