    "Colliders probe energy scales where quarks and gluons interact perturbatively. At leading order, hard scattering processes produce a few high-energy colored partons. However, these partons are not observed directly in the detector. Instead, they radiate additional quarks and gluons as they evolve toward lower virtualities, forming collimated sprays of particles known as jets. This cascade of emissions is governed by the infrared structure of QCD and is captured by a procedure called ***parton showering***. The parton shower resums the dominant soft and collinear logarithms to all orders, providing a probabilistic picture of how a few energetic partons evolve into a complex multibody final state. In Monte Carlo event generators, parton showers play a critical role in bridging the gap between the hard scattering and the nonperturbative hadronization stage. In this tutorial, we'll explore the physics behind parton showers and how they are implemented in modern event generators."
