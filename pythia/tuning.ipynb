For users who are new to Pythia, please first work through the *A \"Hello World\" Program* and *A first realistic analysis* examples of the [Pythia 8.3 Python Worksheet](worksheet8311.ipynb). The appendices can also be useful for users not familiar with some of the technical features of Pythia. [Appendix: The Event Record](worksheet8311.ipynb#eventRecord) contains a brief summary of the event-record structure and [Appendix: Some Facilities](worksheet8311.ipynb#someFacilities) describes the use of some built-in functionality for [Histograms](worksheet8311.ipynb#histograms) and [Jet finding](worksheet8311.ipynb#jetFinding). In this tutorial a focus is given to generating and exploring distributions that are sensitive to Pythia parameters, and is based on the structure of the [Monash Tune paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5630.pdf), including text.\n",

    "The main parameter governing final-state radiation is the effective value of the strong coupling, which in Pythia is specified by giving the value of $\\as(M_\\Z)$. In the Monash tune, a set of light-flavour ($\\u\\d\\s\\c$) tagged $\\e^+\\e^-$ event shapes measured by the L3 experiment were used to extract a best-fit value for $\\as(M_\\Z)$. This prevents $\\B$ decays from contaminating this step of the analysis. Heavy-quark fragmentation is treated separately. The renormalization scale for final-state shower emissions in Pythia is fixed to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_R^2 = \\pTse = z(1-z)Q^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $Q^2 = p^2 - m_0^2$ the offshellness of the emitting parton (with on-shell mass $m_0$), and $z$ the energy fraction appearing in the DGLAP splitting kernels, $P(z)$. To estimate the shower uncertainties associated with this choice of renormalization scale, the Monash authors recommend using $\\ln(\\mu_R^2) \\pm \\ln(2)$, corresponding to a factor $\\sqrt{2}$ variation of $\\mu_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the infrared shower cutoff, the Monash tune authors chose a value close to $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}$, in order to have a smooth transition between low-$\\pT$ perturbative emissions and non-perturbative string breaks, the latter of which involve $\\pT$ kicks of order $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}$. In principle, the perturbative evolution could be continued to even lower scales, if combined with a non-perturbative regularization of $\\as$, but such low cutoff values could risk generating problems at the fragmentation stage since the technical implementation of the string model becomes complicated if there are too many small gluon \"kinks\" spaced closely along the strings.

    "Next, we need to write an event analysis class that allows us to calculate the thrust of an event. Thrust is obtained by varying the thrust axis so that the longitudinal momentum component projected onto it is maximized, and thrust itself is then defined as the sum of absolute longitudinal momenta divided by the sum of absolute momenta. The major axis is found correspondingly in the plane transverse to thrust, and the minor one is then defined to be transverse to both. Oblateness is the difference between the major and the minor values.\n",
    "\n",
    "With RIVET, the analysis would already be defined, but this shows a little bit more of the details. Luckily, Pythia has a built-in thrust method, and so we don't need to calculate thrust from scratch. The calculation of thrust is more computer-time-intensive than *e.g.* linear sphericity, and has no specific advantages except historical precedent. In the Pythia 6 implementation the search was sped up at the price of then not being guaranteed to hit the absolute maximum. The Pythia 8 implementation studies all possibilities, but at the price of being slower, with time consumption for an event with $n$ particles growing like $n^3$."

    "Given a set of post-shower partons, resolved at a scale of $Q_\\mathrm{had} \\sim$ 1 GeV, the non-perturbative stage of the fragmentation modeling now takes over, to convert the partonic state into a set of on-shell hadrons. In the leading-colour approximation, each perturbative dipole is dual to a non-perturbative string piece. Quarks thus become string endpoints, while gluons become transverse kinks, connecting two string pieces. The Lund string fragmentation model describes the fragmentation of such string systems into on-shell hadrons.\n",

Further, since the Monash authrs here choose $\\pTmin$ to be only slightly greater than $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}$, the size of the non-perturbative corrections is naturally limited to kicks/corrections appropriate for non-perturbative dynamics (in contrast, *e.g.*, to the cluster model, which can generate substantially larger kicks, of order the largest allowed cluster mass, which can be several GeV). For the Monash 2013 tune, the authors settled on a value of $\\sigma_\\perp =$ 0.335 GeV, with a small (1%) tail of breaks involving higher $\\pT$ values carried over from the default settings.\n",

The transverse mass of the produced $(ij)$ hadron is defined by $m^2_{\\perp} = m^2_{\\mathrm{had}} + p^2_{\\perp,\\mathrm{had}}$, hence heavier hadrons have harder spectra. The proportionality\n",

Within the Lund model, the $a$ value is normally also taken to be universal, the same for all quarks, with the only freedom being that a larger $a$ parameter can be assigned to diquarks, from which baryons are formed, and hence meson and baryon spectra can be decoupled somewhat.\n",

    "Roughly speaking, large a parameters suppress the hard region $z \\to 1$, while a large $b$ parameter suppresses the soft region $z \\to 0$. By adjusting them independently, both the average hardness and the width of the resulting fragmentation spectra can be modified. For example, increasing both $a$ and $b$ yields a narrower  distribution, while changing them in opposite directions moves the average.

An option for choosing an alternative parameterization is therefore provided, whereby the user specifies the desired average value of the fragmentation function for primary $\\rho$ mesons rather than the $b$ parameter. The $a$ parameter should still be given by `StringZ:aLund` as usual. The $\\rho$ meson has been chosen as a reference since its mass is near the average of the primary hadron production, while pions come to dominate only after secondary decays. This option can be enabled via the flag `StringZ:deriveBLund`. When set to `on`, the $b$ parameter is treated as a derived quantity; *i.e.*, the value of `StringZ:bLund` is ignored in favour of the `StringZ:avgZLund` parameter. The `StringZ:bLund` parameter is then also reset to the derived value so that it can be queried after initialization, if desired. The `StringZ:avgZLund` parameter specifies the average of the fragmentation function for primary $\\rho$ mesons, evaluated at $m^2_{\\perp} = m^2_\\rho + 2\\sigma^2_{\\perp}$. Note that the derived value is allowed to exceed the nominal limits given for `StringZ:bLund` above.

    "The extraction of the $a$ and $b$ parameters from the inclusive charged-particle distributions is made slightly more complicated by the fact that not all observed particles are \"primary\" (originating directly from string breaks); many lower-mass particles are \"secondaries\", produced by prompt decays of more massive states (*e.g.*, $\\rho \\to \\pi \\pi$), whose relative rates and decay kinematics therefore influence the spectra. In the $\\e^+ \\e^â$ measurements we include here, particles with $c\\tau <$ 100 mm were treated as unstable, hence leading to secondaries. For completeness, we note that the equivalent standard cut at the LHC is normally 10 mm. The particle composition in Pythia was already tuned to a set of reference values provided by the PDG , and the default parameters do reasonably well, certainly for the most copiously produced sources of secondaries. Nonetheless, the Monash authors reoptimized the flavour-selection parameters of the string-fragmentation model using a slightly different set of reference data, combining the PDG tables with information provided directly by the LEP experiments via HEPDATA. Based on the level of agreement or disagreement between different measurements of the same particles, the Monash authors used their own judgement as to the level of uncertainty for a few of the particles, as outlined in their paper.\n",

Specifically, the Monash authors increased the overall amount of strangeness by about 10%, while decreasing the rate of vector mesons by a similar amount (these two effects largely cancel for $\\K^*$). This improves the total $\\K^\\pm, \\rho^0, \\omega, \\Lambda, \\Xi^*$, $\\Omega$ yields to the combined LEP estimates discussed above. The price is that measured rate of $\\Xi^\\pm$ baryons is overestimated by 10%.\n",

Heavy flavor (section 2.3) is not covered, neither are hadron collisions (section 3) nor energy scaling (section 4). However, the exercises here should provide sufficient background for study of these additional topics. Note, however, that generating full LHC events can be considerably slower than LEP events."
