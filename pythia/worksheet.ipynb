    "The Pythia 8.3 program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions (specifically, it focuses on centre-of-mass energies greater than about 10 GeV), comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body high-energy (\"hard\") scattering process to a complex multihadronic final state. The particles are produced in vacuum. Simulation of the interaction of the produced particles with detector material is not included in Pythia but can, if needed, be done by interfacing to external detector-simulation codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythia 8.3 code package contains a library of hard interactions and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is to teach you the basics of how to use the Pythia 8.3 event generator to study various physics aspects. As you become more familiar you will better understand the tools at your disposal, and can develop your own style to use them. Within this first exercise it is not possible to describe the physics models used in the program; for this we refer to the [Pythia 8.3 manual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11601), and to all the further references found in them. For practical usage, the [Pythia 8.3 HTML manual](https://pythia.org/manuals/pythia8311/Welcome.html) provides full documentation on running and configuring Pythia. A local version of this manual can be accessed by opening `htmldoc/Welcome.html` in a browser. A [Pythia 8.3 Doxygen manual](https://pythia.org/doxygen/pythia8311) is also available, although the HTML manual should always be used as the primary documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythia 8 is, by today's standards, a small package. It is completely self-contained, and is therefore easy to install for standalone usage, e.g. if you want to have it on your own laptop, or if you want to explore physics or debug code without any danger of destructive interference between different libraries. This worksheet uses Pythia's Python interface, using an installation included in the Docker container. If you would like to run Pythia 8.3 natively using `C++`, please take a look at the analogous [standalone worksheet](https://pythia.org/download/pdf/worksheet8200.pdf), which includes installation instructions. You can download the latest version at [pythia.org](https://pythia.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Pythia you are expected to write the main program yourself, for maximal flexibility and power. Several examples of such main programs are included with the code, to illustrate common tasks and help getting started. The section [A \"Hello World\" Program](#helloWorld) gives you a simple step-by-step recipe how to write a minimal main program, that can then gradually be expanded in different directions, e.g. as in [A first realistic analysis](#realisticAnalysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section [Input files](#inputFiles) you will see how the parameters of a run can be read in from a file, so that the main program can be kept fixed. Many of the provided `C++` main programs therefore allow you to create executables that can be used for different physics studies without recompilation, but potentially at the cost of some flexibility. For Python usage, this is not an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final three sections provide suggestions for optional further studies, and can be addressed in any order. [CKKW-L merging](#ckkwl) deals with the important topic of merging of external matrix-element input of different orders, introducing the CKKW-L scheme as a suitable starting point. [Some studies of Higgs production](#higgsProduction) describes how you can explore various physics aspects of the Standard Model Higgs production and decay. [Further studies](#furtherStudies), finally, collects suggestions for a few diverse studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Pythia can be run standalone, it can also be interfaced with a set of other libraries. One example is `HepMC`, which is the standard format used by experimentalists to store generated events. Further main programs included with the Pythia code provide examples of linking, e.g., to `AlpGen`, `MadGraph`, `PowHeg`, `FastJet`, `ROOT`, and the Les Houches Accords LHEF, LHAPDF and SLHA.\n",

    "An important part of the event record is that many copies of the same particle may exist, but only those with a positive status code are still present in the final state. To exemplify, consider a top quark produced in the hard interaction, initially with positive status code. When later a shower branching $\\t \\to \\t \\g$ occurs, the new $\\t$ and $\\g$ are added at the bottom of the then-current event record, but the old $\\t$ is not removed. It is marked as decayed, however, by negating its status code. At any stage of the shower there is thus only one \"current\" copy of the top. After the shower, when the final top decays, $\\t \\to \\b \\W^+$, also that copy receives a negative status code. When you understand the basic principles, see if you can find several copies of the top quarks, and check the status codes to figure out why each new copy has been added. Also note how the mother/daughter indices tie together the various copies."

This will give reliable results for soft and collinear configurations, but less so for  multiple hard, well-separated jets. To model the latter similarly well, we need to include external input from higher-order calculations at tree level and, where feasible, at one-loop level. A number of different external programs can provide such input, using the LHA/LHEF standard format to transfer information, usually as LHE files (see [Generic User Process Interface for Event Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109068), [A standard format for Les Houches Event Files](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609017), and [Les Houches 2013: Physics at TeV Colliders: Standard Model Working Group Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1067)). The hard-process events stored in these files will be accepted or rejected in such a way that  doublecounting between different parton multiplicities is removed, resulting in a smooth transition between the multiplicities, and between the external input and the internal handling of parton showers.

    "## Some studies of Higgs production\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of the Higgs boson has been one of the main accomplishments of the LHC to date. Generators have been part of that story, right from the early days when the ATLAS and CMS detectors were designed in such a way as to permit that discovery. This section offers exercises intended to explore the physics of Higgs production from various aspects, with *Pythia* as guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant production channel is $\\g\\g\\to\\H^0$. To study the kinematics distribution of the Higgs, the existing top production program could easily be modified. Instead of switching on top production, use `HiggsSM:gg2H = on`. And instead of looking for the last top copy before decay, look for the last Higgs copy `prtH`, ie. the last particle with `id() == 25`. Once found the `prtH` methods can be used to extract and histogram Higgs kinematics distributions, like for the top. In addition to the transverse momentum `pT()` you can compare the distributions for true rapidity `y()` and for pseudorapidity `eta()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production processes\n",
    "\n",
    "While $\\g\\g \\to \\H^0$ is the main Higgs production channel, it is not the only one. Do a run with `HiggsSM:all = on` to check which are implemented and their relative importance. Also figure out how you could generate one of the less frequent processes on its own, either from the [HTML manual](https://pythia.org/manuals/pythia8311/Welcome.html) or by making some deductions from the output with all processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get decent cross-section statistics faster, you can use `PartonLevel:all = off` to switch off everything except the hard-process generation itself. One price to pay is that the kinematics distributions for the Higgs are not meaningful. If instead complete events are generated you can study how the transverse-momentum distribution varies between processes. What are the reasons behind the significant differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decay channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the decay channels and branching ratios in the Higgs decay are of interest. Here no ready-made statistics routines exist, so you have to do it yourself. You already have the decaying Higgs, `prtH`. Since the standard decay modes are two-body, they can be accessed as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dau1 = pythia.event[prtH.daughter1()]\n",
    "dau2 = pythia.event[prtH.daughter2()]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and from that you can get the identities of the daughters. Introduce counters for all the decay modes you come to think of,that you use to derive and print branching ratios. Print the daughter identities in the leftover decays, where you did not yet have any counters, and iterate until you catch it all.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this case, `PartonLevel:all = off` cannot be used, since then one does not get to the decays, at least not with the information in `pythia.event`. But you can combine\n",
    "```\n",
    "PartonLevel:ISR = off # to switch off initial-state radiation,\n",
    "PartonLevel:FSR = off # to switch off final-state radiation,\n",
    "PartonLevel:MPI = off # to switch off multiparton interactions, and\n",
    "HadronLevel:all = off # to switch off hadronization and decays,\n",
    "```\n",
    "to get almost the same net time saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "By now the Higgs mass is pretty well pinned down, but you can check what the branching ratios would have been with another mass, e.g. by `25:m0 = 150.` for a 150 GeV Higgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a related note, the Higgs mass is generated according to a Breit-Wigner distribution, convoluted with parton densities. Can you resolve this shape for the default Higgs mass? How does it change had the Higgs been heavier, say at 400 GeV? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Associated jets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us return to the different production channels, which give different event characteristics. Well-known is that the $\\q \\q \\to \\q \\q \\H^0$ processes give rise to jets at large rapidities, that can be used for tagging purposes. This can be studied as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two relevant processes are `HiggsSM:ff2Hff(t:ZZ)` and `HiggsSM:ff2Hff(t:WW)` for $\\Z^0 \\Z^0$ and $\\W^+ \\W^-$\n",
    "fusion ($\\f$ here denotes a fermion; the same processes also exist e.g. at $\\e^+ \\e^-$ colliders), that are to be compared with the standard $\\g\\g \\to \\H^0$ one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find jets using the `SlowJet` class, see [Jet finding](#jetFinding), e.g. using the anti-$k_{\\perp}$ algorithm with $R = 0.7$, $p_{\\perp\\mathrm{min}} = 30$~GeV and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}} = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem is that also the Higgs decay products can give jets, which we are not interested in here. To avoid this, we can switch off Higgs decays by `25:mayDecay = off`. This still leaves the Higgs itself\n",
    "in the event record. A call `prtH.statusNeg()` will negate its status code, and since `slowJet.analyze(...)` only considers the final particles, i.e. those with positive status, the Higgs is thus eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now study the $\\pT$ and rapidity spectrum of the hardest jets, and compare those distributions for the two processes. Also study how many jets are produced in the two cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underlying event\n",
    "\n",
    "Several mechanisms contribute to the overall particle production in Higgs events. This can be studied e.g. by histogramming the charged particle distribution.    \n",
    "\n",
    "You then need to have a counter set to zero for each new event. Inside the particle loop this counter should be incremented whenever the particle `isFinal()` and `isCharged()`. For the histogram, note that it can be treacherous to have bin limits at integers, where roundoff errors decide whichever way they go. In this particular case only even numbers are possible, so 100 bins from $-1$ to 399 would still be acceptable, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the distribution down for normal events, study what happens if you remove ISR, FSR and MPI one by one or all together. Also study the contribution of the Higgs decay itself to the multiplicity, e.g. by setting the Higgs stable. Reflect on why different combinations give the pattern they do, e.g. why ISR on/off makes a bigger difference when MPI is on than off. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decay properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The decay mode $\\H^0 \\to \\Z^0 \\Z^0 \\to \\ell^+ \\ell^- \\ell'^+ \\ell'^-$, $\\ell, \\ell' = \\e, \\mu$, is called the gold-plated one, since it stands out so well from backgrounds. It also offers angular correlations that probe the spin of a Higgs candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now consider a simpler, but still interesting, pair of distributions: the mass spectra of the two $\\Z^0$ decay products. Plot them for the lighter and the heavier of the two separately, and compare shapes and average values. To improve statistics, you can use `25:onMode = off` to switch off all decay channels, and then `25:onIfMatch = 23 23` to switch back on the decay to $\\Z^0 \\Z^0$ (and nothing else). Further, neither ISR, FSR, MPI nor hadronization affect the mass distributions, so this allows some speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can one qualitatively understand why the two masses tend to be so far apart, rather than roughly comparable? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with $\\Z^0$ production\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key reference processes at hadron colliders is $\\Z^0$ production. To lowest order it only involves one process, $\\q\\qbar \\to \\gamma^*/\\Z^0$, accessible with `WeakSingleBoson:ffbar2gmZ = on`. One complication is that the process involves $\\gamma^*/\\Z^0$ interference, and so a significant enhancement at low masses, even if the combined particle always is classified with code 23, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the two processes $\\g\\g \\to \\H^0$ and $\\q\\qbar \\to \\gamma^*/\\Z^0$, with respect to the $\\pT$ distribution of the boson and the total charged multiplicity of the events. So as to remove the dependence on the difference\n",

    "`PhaseSpace:mHatMax = 126`, to agree with the $\\H^0$ mass to $\\pm$ 1 GeV.\n",
    "\n",

    "- One popular misconception is that the energy and momentum of a $\\B$ meson has to be smaller than that of its mother $\\b$ quark, and similarly for charm. The fallacy is twofold. Firstly, if the $\\b$  quark is surrounded by nearby colour-connected gluons, the $\\B$ meson may also pick up some of the momentum of these gluons. Secondly, the concept of smaller momentum is not Lorentz-frame-independent: if the other end of the $\\b$ colour force field is a parton with a higher momentum (such as a beam remnant) the \"drag\" of the hadronization process may imply an acceleration in the lab frame (but a deceleration in the beam rest frame). To study this, simulate $\\b$ production, e.g. the process `HardQCD:gg2bbbar`. Identify $\\B / \\B^*$ mesons that come directly from the hadronization, for simplicity those with status code $-83$ or $-84$. In the former case the mother $\\b$ quark is in the `mother1()` position, in the latter in `mother2()` (study a few event listings to see how it works). Plot the ratio of $\\B$ to $\\b$ energy to see what it looks like."

Another special case is the description of ISR by backwards evolution, where the mother is constructed at a later stage than the daughter, and therefore appears below it in the event listing. \n",

Firstly, previously unrelated colours and anticolours taken from the beams may at this stage be associated with each other, and be relabelled accordingly. Secondly, it appears that the close space-time overlap of many colour fields leads to reconnections, i.e. a swapping of colour labels, that tends to reduce the total length of field lines."

Correspondingly, the other bins have contents 179, 123, 207 and 283. The first bin stretches from $-(1 \\times 10^1 + 0 \\times 10^0) = -10$ to the beginning of the second bin, at $-(0 \\times 10^1 + 5 \\times 10^0) = -5$.\n",

An `X` means that the contents are filled up to this level, a digit in the topmost row the fraction to which the last level is filled. So the `9` of the first column indicates this bin is filled 9/10 of the way from $3.00 \\times 10^2 = 300$ to $3.50 \\times 10^2 = 350$, i.e. somewhere close to 345, or more precisely in the range 342.5 to 347.5.\n",

    "The printout also provides some other information, such as the number of entries, i.e. how many times the histogram has been filled, the total weight inside the histogram, the total weight in underflow and overflow, and the mean value and root-mean-square width (disregarding underflow and overflow). The mean and width assumes that all the contents is in the middle of the respective bin. This is especially relevant when you plot a integer quantity, such as a multiplicity. Then it makes sense to book with limits that are half-integers, e.g."
