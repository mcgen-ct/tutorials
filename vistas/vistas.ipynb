    "The idea behind VISTAS, a Visualization Interface for Particle Collision Simulations, is to provide a more intuitive way to visualize high energy particle collisions as produced by Monte Carlo event generators. In this initial version of VISTAS, the focus has been to convert the output of Pythia into an interactive visual representation of the event generation process, where the different steps of high energy physics MC event generation are shown, including hard process, parton shower, and hadronization. This is different from experimental event displays, where events are displayed as reconstructed by the detector from real data.\n",
